One Route to rule them all

## Features

OneRoute is a Flutter navigation package inspired by the legendary journey of the One Ring from the Lord of the Rings saga. It is designed to be a centralized, type-safe, and modular navigation system for your Flutter application, ensuring smooth and efficient routing between screens while maintaining scalability for projects of any size.

Just as the One Ring united the diverse elements of Middle-earth, OneRoute brings all your app's navigation needs under one unified and powerful system. With support for modular architecture, type-safe arguments, and global route management, this package simplifies routing in both small and large-scale projects.
